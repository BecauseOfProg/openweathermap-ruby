## Why would I use this library ?

Before writing this OpenWeatherMap implementation, I checked for existing ones on rubygems.org. There's only small libraries, that has at least one or two good thing but that's all. Consequently, I decided to make my own one, combining all their advantages :

- **Centralized :** all the options and fetch methods are stored in one class, that is initialized only once in all the program. Parameters are the same across all requests.
- **Fast :** the only thing that can slow the library is your Internet connection : indeed, no heavy operations are made in the background. As soon as it receives weather conditions, the only step for it is organizing them.
- **Simple :** the library only contains essential operations to keep the number of methods low. Moreover, all the information is perfectly human-readable.
- **Documented :** every method and class attribute is explained and every exception thrown is explicit, therefore learning or debugging the library remains easy.

This work resulted in a powerful implementation that responds to primary needs while staying abordable.

## üìå Requirements

This library requires an updated version of Ruby.

## üîß Setup

### Quick installation

If you want to quickly test the library, you can install it using the `install` command of Ruby Gem.

```bash
gem install openweathermap
```

### Gemfile

If you setup the library for medium or big projects, it's recommended to write it in your Gemfile.

```gemfile
gem 'openweathermap', '~> 0.2.2'
```

After, use again the `install` command, but without the package name.

```bash
gem install
```

### Build

You can also compile it by yourself. First, clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BecauseOfProg/openweathermap-ruby.git  # HTTP
          git@github.com:BecauseOfProg/openweathermap-ruby.git      # SSH
```

Then, build the gemspec file to create the gem.

```bash
gem build ./openweathermap.gemspec
```

Finally, install it on your system.

```bash
gem install ./openweathermap-0.2.2.gem
```

## ‚å® Basic interactions

Once you finished installing the library, you're ready to play around.

### Setup the API

First of all, include the `openweathermap` library in your project :

```ruby
include 'openweathermap'
```

Then, we must initialize an `API` object in the `OpenWeatherMap` module, that we'll use to get our weather data.

```ruby
api = OpenWeatherMap::API.new(API_KEY, 'en', 'metric')
```

The constructor takes three parameters :

- The first is an API key, that can be generated on the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/appid)
- The second is the language of the data. It can be one of these : Arabic - ar, Bulgarian - bg, Catalan - ca, Czech - cz, German - de, Greek - el, English - en, Persian (Farsi) - fa, Finnish - fi, French - fr, Galician - gl, Croatian - hr, Hungarian - hu, Italian - it, Japanese - ja, Korean - kr, Latvian - la, Lithuanian - lt, Macedonian - mk, Dutch - nl, Polish - pl, Portuguese - pt, Romanian - ro, Russian - ru, Swedish - se, Slovak - sk, Slovenian - sl, Spanish - es, Turkish - tr, Ukrainian - ua, Vietnamese - vi, Chinese Simplified - zh_cn, Chinese Traditional - zh_tw.
- The third is the unit system. It can be one of these :
  - none (temperatures in Kelvin)
  - metric (temperatures in Celsius)
  - imperial (temperatures in Fahrenheit)

### Get current weather

To get the current weather at a certain city anywhere in the world, use the `current` method of the API object :

```ruby
api.current('Lyon,FR')
```

It only takes one parameter : the location. It can be one of this type :

- A simple string : search by city name. To have more precision, it can be completed with the country code separated by a comma
- An integer : search by city ID (refer to [OpenWeatherMap](http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/city.list.json.gz))
- An array : search by coordinates (format : [longitude, latitude])

The method will return a `OpenWeatherMap::CurrentWeather` object that you can explore [on RubyDoc](http://rubydoc.info/gems/openweathermap/0.2.2/OpenWeatherMap/CurrentWeather).

### Get forecast

To get the forecast for a certain city anywhere in the world, use the `forecast` method of the API object :

```ruby
api.forecast('Paris,FR')
```

Its parameter is the same as the `current` method. It will return a `OpenWeatherMap::Forecast` object that you can explore [on RubyDoc](http://rubydoc.info/gems/openweathermap/0.2.2/OpenWeatherMap/Forecast).

### Possible exceptions

Your requests may return exceptions that are in the `OpenWeatherMap::Exceptions` module :

- An `Unauthorized` exception, caused when your API key is wrong
- An `UnknownLocation` exception, caused if the location you wrote is wrong

These exceptions will have in their body the message sent by the OpenWeatherMap API, so you can easily debug them.
